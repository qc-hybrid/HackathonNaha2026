title:  Current and Future Computational Approaches to Quantum Many-Body Systems 2026 (CompQMB2026)
---

# About
This workshop is focused on developing current and future computational methods and applications for quantum many-body systems, providing opportunities for future collaborations. The topics will cover quantum embedding theories, tensor networks, machine learning, and quantum algorithms/information.

A related hackathon will be held on March 6 - 8 (just after the workshop) in Naha. See [here](https://qc-hybrid.github.io/hackathon_in_okinawa_2026) for more details.
