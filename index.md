# About
AI tools in software development and data science have already led to dramatic productivity gains.
However, adoption in computational physics is still in its early stages.

This hackathon offers practical, hands-on training on **integrating AI tools into the workflow of computational physics, e.g., coding and data analysis**.
Our focus will be the use of AI-powered development tools such as
VS code Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, etc.

It is an ideal entry point for:
- students and postdocs already engaged in research, and 
- a re-skilling opportunity for senior researchers.

Participants are expected to have prior experience in coding and numerical simulations.
